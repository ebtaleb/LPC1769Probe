This repository contains code related to the programming of the
LPC1769 board.

LPCXpresso is required to run that code.

- WPN-SN is a project involving the creation of a probe sampling different
measurements (light, temperature, movement) and send them to a computer using an XBee shield.
- DeviceDemos contains various projects that helps to be acquainted with
the libraries APIs and the devices present in the board.

Mode regular:
- Sensor sampling
- Sampling rate change
- Temp alarm
- UART report
- Indicator regular (oled screen or led array)

Mode Relay:
- Sensor sampling
- UART relay + report
- Indicator relay (using the oled screen)

Sensors

* Light Sensor
- sample light measurement every LS_ST
- change sampling rate if the light is bright/dim in Regular Mode

* Accelerometer
- sample zAcc
- compute variance

* Temperature sensor
- sample Temp sensor (DONE)
- sound alarm in regular mode (sound alarm DONE)
